This is a terminal tetris game written in Python.


Includes a main menu, high score tracking (top 5, rest get wiped) level selection.

I tried to keep it true to tetris on the gameboy, but I'll keep at it.

Mostly made this for personal use, while I wait for other things to load.

I'd like to port it to rust at some point.
